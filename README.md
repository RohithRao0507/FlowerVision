# Flower Identification Model

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a neural network model capable of identifying flower species from images. The model is designed to handle both clear and blurred images, applying image processing techniques to enhance image quality where necessary before making predictions.

## Features
- **Image Processing:** Incorporates techniques to detect and correct blurriness in flower images using Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and other advanced methods.
- **Deep Learning Model:** Utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture to classify flowers into various species.
- **Data Augmentation:** Employs real-time data augmentation to increase the diversity of the training dataset, improving the robustness of the model.

## Prerequisites
Before running this project, you need to install the following:
- Python 3.8 or newer
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-Image, PyLops

You can install all required libraries with the following command:
```bash
pip install tensorflow numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-image pylops
```

## Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-directory>
```

## Usage
To run the model, execute the Jupyter notebook `flower-recognizing-model-blurred-images.ipynb`:
```bash
jupyter notebook flower-recognizing-model-blurred-images.ipynb
```
Follow the instructions in the notebook to train and test the flower identification model.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of flower images categorized by species, stored under the `flowers` directory. Each subdirectory within `flowers` represents a species and contains images corresponding to that flower type.

## Model Architecture
The model uses a series of convolutional, max pooling, and dense layers to process and classify images. Data augmentation techniques such as rotation and zoom are applied to train the model effectively.

## Model Advantages and Next Steps
### Pros
- **High Classification Accuracy:** The model excels in accurately identifying a wide range of flower species, making it highly effective for educational and research applications where precision is crucial.
- **Advanced Image Processing:** With built-in capabilities to correct for image blurriness, the model ensures consistent performance across varying image qualities, ideal for real-world scenarios where image capture conditions are not always controlled.
- **Specificity and Sensitivity:** The model demonstrates a high specificity, minimizing false positives, which is essential for applications that rely on precise species identification.

### Actionable Steps for Improvement
- **Reducing Misclassifications:** While the model performs well overall, it occasionally confuses similar species. We plan to incorporate a more diverse dataset and possibly integrate additional features such as flower context or habitat information to enhance differentiation capabilities.
- **Mitigating Overfitting:** To address potential overfitting, we will experiment with regularization techniques and adjust the complexity of the neural network. Additionally, implementing more comprehensive cross-validation can help ensure the model generalizes well to new data.
- **Enhancing Data Diversity:** The performance of the model is dependent on the robustness of the training data. Future versions will focus on expanding the dataset to include underrepresented species and introducing more varied image conditions. Community contributions of images or data sources are warmly welcomed.

### How You Can Contribute
- **Data Contributions:** If you have access to flower images, especially those of species that are underrepresented in our current dataset, your contributions would be invaluable.
- **Model Testing and Feedback:** We encourage users to test the model in different settings and provide feedback on its performance. Such insights are crucial for ongoing refinement.
- **Feature Suggestions:** If you have ideas on features that could improve the model, such as additional preprocessing steps or alternative architecture designs, please share them or contribute code directly.
